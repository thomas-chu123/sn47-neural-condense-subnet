They were separated by price into 2 different boxes. In the first box, he found 10 movies that he wanted. These were $2.00 apiece. The second box was marked $5 each and he found 5 movies he wanted. What was the average price of each of the DVDs he bought? [/INST] To find the average price of each of the DVDs, we need to calculate the total cost of all the DVDs and divide it by the total number of DVDs. Duke bought 10 DVDs at $2 each, so the total cost for these DVDs is 10 * $2 = $20. He also bought 5 DVDs at $5 each, so the total cost for these DVDs is 5 * $5 = $25. The total cost of all the DVDs is $20 + $25 = $45. The total number of DVDs is 10 + 5 = 15. So, the average price of each DVD is $45 / 15 = $3. Thus, the average price of each of the DVDs he bought is \boxed{3} dollars.</s> [INST] Get Whiter Teeth Today With This Great Advice. Do you have stained, discolored teeth?

CHAPTER X: BESET During the winter Hannibal made every preparation to ensure the tranquillity of Spain while he was absent. In order to lessen the number of possible enemies there he raised a body of twelve hundred horse and fourteen thousand infantry from among the most turbulent tribes, and sent them across to Africa to serve as garrisons in Carthage and other points, while an equal number of African troops were brought over to garrison Spain, of which Hasdrubal, Hannibal's brother, was to have the government during his absence. Hanno, an able general, was to command the force which was to be left in southern Gaul to keep open the communications between the Pyrenees and the Alps, while the youngest brother, Mago, a youth of about the same age as Malchus, was to accompany him to Italy. Hannibal's wife and a child which had been born in the preceding spring, were sent by ship to Carthage. In the early spring the march commenced, the army following the coast line until it reached the mouth of the Ebro. The mountainous and broken country lying between this river and the Pyrenees, and now known as Catalonia, was inhabited by fierce tribes unconquered as yet by Roman or Carthaginian. Its conquest presented enormous difficulties. There was no coherence between its people; but each valley and mountain was a stronghold to be defended desperately until the last. The inhabitants, accustomed to the mountains, were hardy, active, and, vigourous, ready to oppose a desperate resistance so long as resistance was possible, and then to flee across their hills at a speed which defied the fleetest of their pursuers. Where were Hannibal's family?

First, find $T_{min}$: \[ T_{min} = 1 + 2 + \cdots + 75 = \frac{75 \cdot 76}{2} = 2850 \] Next, find $T_{max}$: \[ T_{max} = 16 + 17 + \cdots + 90 = (1 + 2 + \cdots + 90) - (1 + 2 + \cdots + 15) \] \[ T_{max} = \frac{90 \cdot 91}{2} - \frac{15 \cdot 16}{2} = 4095 - 120 = 3975 \] The number of possible values of $T$ is: \[ T_{max} - T_{min} + 1 = 3975 - 2850 + 1 = 1126 \] So, the answer is: \[ \boxed{1126} \]</s> [INST] Express the repeating decimal $0.\overline{123}$ as a fraction in lowest terms, using only geometric series and algebraic manipulations. [/INST] Let $x = 0.\overline{123}$. Since $x$ is a repeating decimal, we can write: \[ 1000x = 123.\overline{123} \] Subtract $x$ from $1000x$: \[ 1000x - x = 123.\overline{123} - 0.\overline{123} \Rightarrow 999x = 123 \Rightarrow x = \frac{123}{999} \] Simplify the fraction: \[ \frac{123}{999} = \frac{41}{333} \] Thus, the repeating decimal $0.\overline{123}$ can be expressed as a fraction in lowest terms as $\boxed{\frac{41}{333}}$.</s> [INST] Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: "That's Glenn Miller," my father said. "But it can't be." He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. "You know the tune, of course," he said. "'King Porter Stomp.'" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. "He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version." "So why can't it be Miller?" I asked. "He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that." The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. "They sound drunk." My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf. Question: What does the father believe about the narrator? Options: A. That he loves Edith Piaf B. That he likes musicians playing like they are drunk C. not enough information D. That he knows this song Answer: [/INST] D</s> [INST] If $g(x)$ is a function defined only for $-1 \le x \le 0$, and $g(x) = cx+d$ for constants $c$ and $d$ where $c > 0$, then what is the range of $g$ in terms of $c$ and $d$? Express your answer in interval notation. [/INST] Since $g(x) = cx + d$ and $-1 \le x \le 0$, we can find the range of $g(x)$ by evaluating the function at the endpoints of the domain. First, evaluate $g(x)$ at $x = -1$: \[ g(-1) = c(-1) + d = -c + d \] Next, evaluate $g(x)$ at $x = 0$: \[ g(0) = c(0) + d = d \] Since $c > 0$, we know that $-c + d < d$. Therefore, the range of $g(x)$ is the interval $[-c + d, d]$. The range of $g$ in terms of $c$ and $d$ is: \[ \boxed{[-c + d, d]} \]</s> [INST] What should I do if a question is answered via email?
